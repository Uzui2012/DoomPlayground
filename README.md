Using the VizDoom environment to showcase a variety of reinforcement learning models.

First is a simple DQN model agent. 

Will record the model loss, episode score, episode duration - on the Doom Basic environment we should see from a successful agent that the duration is able to decrease as the agent learns to shoot the demon with more efficiency.
